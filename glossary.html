          <dt><h4>Science</h4></dt>
            <dd>- is, in its broadest sense, any systematic knowledge-base or prescriptive practice that is capable of resulting in a correct prediction, or reliably-predictable type of outcome. ...<br/>- The systematic study of humans and their environment based on the deductions and inferences which can be made, and the general laws which can be formulated, from reproducible observations and measurements of events and parameters within the universe.<br/>- skill: ability to produce solutions in some problem domain<br/>- a particular branch of scientific knowledge</dd>
          <dt><h4>Staging</h4></dt>
            <dd>selecting, designing, adapting to, or modifying the performance space; the look of the performance; the result of this process, in other words the spectacle that a play presents in performance, its visual detail. (for GD purposes &ldquo;performance&rdquo; refers to the animations and content contained in the motion graphic itself)</dd>
          <dt><h4>Suspension of Disbelief</h4></dt>
            <dd>Suspension of disbelief or "willing suspension of disbelief" is a formula for justifying the use of fantastic or non-realistic elements in literature. It was put forth in English by the poet and aesthetic philosopher Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who suggested that if a writer could infuse a "human interest and a semblance of truth" into a fantastic tale, the reader would suspend judgement concerning the implausibility of the narrative.
The phrase "suspension of disbelief" came to be used more loosely in the later 20th century, often used to imply that the onus was on the reader, rather than the writer, to achieve it. It might be used to refer to the willingness of the audience to overlook the limitations of a medium, so that these do not interfere with the acceptance of those premises. These fictional premises may also lend to the engagement of the mind and perhaps proposition of thoughts, ideas, art and theories.<br/> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_of_disbelief">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_of_disbelief</a></dd>
